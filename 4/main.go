// source exercise: codility 3.frog_jump
/*
For example, given:
  X = 10, as stating position of frog
  Y = 85, as minimum position should frog will be positioned at
  D = 30, fix length of frog jump

the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:
  - after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
  - after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
  - after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
  - X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
  - X â‰¤ Y.
